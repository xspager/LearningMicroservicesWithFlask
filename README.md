# Learning Microservices with Flask
 
I'll attempt to learn WTF are Microservices following https://github.com/reritom/Flask-Microservice-Tutorial and https://github.com/cloudacademy/python-flask-microservices and see how it goes. Might sprinkle a service in Django just because.

Feel free to open issues with suggestions, comments and corrections. If you really feel like sending a PR make it very specific.
